  <h1 align="center">HIV-AIDS Pandemic</h1>
<h2>Death Toll: 36 million</h2>
<h2>Cause: HIV-AIDS</h2>
  
  <p>First identified in Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976, HIV/AIDS has truly proven itself as a global pandemic, killing more than 36 million people since 1981. Currently there are between 31 and 35 million people living with HIV, the vast majority of those are in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 5% of the population is infected, roughly 21 million people. As awareness has grown, new treatments have been developed that make HIV far more manageable, and many of those infected go on to lead productive lives. Between 2005 and 2012 the annual global deaths from HIV/AIDS dropped from 2.2 million to 1.6 million.</p>

    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact or blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding.</p>
    <p>To become infected with HIV, infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>By having sex. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity.</li>
        <li>By sharing needles. Sharing contaminated IV drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis.</li>
        <li>From blood transfusions. In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. American hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies, so this risk is very small.</li>
        <li>During pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding. Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. Mothers who are HIV-positive and get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies.</li>
    </ul>
 </div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(253, 10, 213);">
    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>Some people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within two to four weeks after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary (acute) HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Muscle aches and joint pain</li>
        <li>Rash</li>
        <li>Sore throat and painful mouth sores</li>
        <li>Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck</li>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Night sweats</li>
    </ul>
</div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(10, 160, 247);">
    <h3>Prevention</h3>
    <p>There's no vaccine to prevent HIV infection and no cure for AIDS. But you can protect yourself and others from infection.
        To help prevent the spread of HIV:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use treatment as prevention (TasP). If you're living with HIV, taking HIV medication can keep your partner from becoming infected with the virus. If you make sure your viral load stays undetectable — a blood test doesn't show any virus — you won't transmit the virus to anyone else. </li>
        <li>Use post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) if you've been exposed to HIV. If you think you've been exposed through sex, needles or in the workplace, contact your doctor or go to the emergency department. Taking PEP as soon as possible within the first 72 hours can greatly reduce your risk of becoming infected with HIV.</li>
        <li>Use a new condom every time you have sex. </li>
        <li>Consider preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The combination drugs emtricitabine plus tenofovir (Truvada) and emtricitabine plus tenofovir alafenamide (Descovy) can reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk. </li>
        <li>Use a clean needle</li>
        <li>If you're pregnant, get medical care right away.</li>
    </ul>
