<h2>Death Toll: 300 million</h2>
  <h2>Cause: Variola virus</h2>
  
  <p>Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by one of two virus variants, Variola major and Variola minor. The agent of variola virus (VARV) belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus. The last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977, and the World Health Organization (WHO) certified the global eradication of the disease in 1980. The risk of death after contracting the disease was about 30%, with higher rates among babies.Often those who survived had extensive scarring of their skin, and some were left blind.

  <div class="column" style="background-color:rgba(241, 245, 7, 0.973);">
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>Directly from person to person. Direct transmission of the virus requires fairly prolonged face-to-face contact. The virus can be transmitted through the air by droplets that escape when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.</p>
    <p>Indirectly from an infected person. In rare instances, airborne virus can spread farther, possibly through the ventilation system in a building, infecting people in other rooms or on other floors.</p>
    <p>Via contaminated items. Smallpox can also spread through contact with contaminated clothing and bedding, although the risk of infection from these sources is less common.</p>
    <p>As a terrorist weapon, potentially. A deliberate release of smallpox is a remote threat. However, because any release of the virus could spread the disease quickly, government officials have taken numerous precautions to protect against this possibility, such as stockpiling smallpox vaccine.</p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(253, 10, 213);">
    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>The first symptoms of smallpox usually appear 10 to 14 days after you're infected. During the incubation period of seven to 17 days, you look and feel healthy and can't infect others.</p>
    <p>Following the incubation period, a sudden onset of flu-like signs and symptoms occurs. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Overall discomfort</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Severe back pain</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A few days later, flat, red spots appear first on your face, hands and forearms, and later on your trunk. Within a day or two, many of these lesions turn into small blisters filled with clear fluid, which then turns into pus. Scabs begin to form eight to nine days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars.</p>
</div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(10, 160, 247);">
    <h3>Prevention</h3>
    <p>In the event of an outbreak, people who had smallpox would be kept in isolation in an effort to control the spread of the virus.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anyone who had contact with someone who developed an infection would need a smallpox vaccine, which can prevent or lessen the severity of the disease if given within four days of exposure to the smallpox virus.</li>
        <li>Two vaccines are available. One vaccine (ACAM2000) uses a live virus that's related to smallpox, and it can occasionally cause serious complications, such as infections affecting the heart or brain.</li>
        <li>That's why it's not recommended that everyone be vaccinated at this time. The potential risks of the vaccine outweigh the benefits, in the absence of an actual smallpox outbreak.</li>
        <li>A second vaccine, a modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine (Jynneos), has been found to be safe, and it can be used in people who aren't able to take ACAM2000, who have weakened immune systems or who have skin disorders.</li>
