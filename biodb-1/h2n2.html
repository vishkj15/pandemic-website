  <h2>Death Toll: 2 million</h2>
  <h2>Cause: Influenza</h2>
      <p>
        Asian Flu was a pandemic outbreak of Influenza A of the H2N2 subtype, which originated in China in 1956 and lasted until 1958. In its two-year spree, Asian Flu traveled from the Chinese province of Guizhou to Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United States. Estimates for the death toll of the Asian Flu vary depending on the source, but the World Health Organization places the final tally at approximately 2 million deaths, 69,800 of those in the US alone.

    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>Influenza viruses such as H2N2 infect the cells that line your nose, throat and lungs. </p>
    <p>The virus enters your body when you inhale contaminated droplets or transfer live virus from a contaminated surface to your eyes, nose or mouth.</p>
    <p>You can't catch swine flu from eating pork.</p>
    <p>Seasonal influenza kills an estimated 36,000 people in the United States each year.</p>
    <p>If you live in or travel to an area where many people are infected with the H1N1 virus, you may be exposed to the virus.</p>
