  <h2>Death Toll: 3 million</h2>
  <h2>Cause: Novel Coronavirus</h2>
      <p> The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 10 April 2021, more than 135 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 2.92 million deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.

    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>Infection with the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</p>
    <p>Data has shown that it spreads mainly from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.</p>
    <p>Researchers believe that the virus may have been passed from bats to another animal — either snakes or pangolins — and then transmitted to humans. </p>
    <p>The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.</p>
    <p>In some situations, the COVID-19 virus can spread by a person being exposed to small droplets or aerosols that stay in the air for several minutes or hours — called airborne transmission.</p>
    <p>It can also spread if a person touches a surface or object with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes, but the risk is low.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>Signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may appear two to 14 days after exposure. This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period. Common signs and symptoms can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Muscle aches</li>
        <li>a loss of taste or smell</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Rash</li>
        <li>Runny nose</li>
    </ul>
</div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(10, 160, 247);">
    <h3>Prevention</h3>
    <p>A vaccine can prevent you from getting the COVID-19 virus or prevent you from becoming seriously ill if you get the COVID-19 virus. Also, if you are fully vaccinated, you can return to many activities you may not have been able to do because of the pandemic — including not wearing a mask or social distancing — except where required by a rule or law</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick or has symptoms.</li>
        <li>Avoid crowds and indoor places that have poor ventilation.</li>
        <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
        <li>Wear a face mask in indoor public spaces and outdoors where there is a high risk of COVID-19 transmission</li>
        <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
        <li>Stay home from work, school and public areas if you're sick, unless you're going to get medical care. Avoid public transportation, taxis and ride-sharing if you're sick.</li>
        <li>Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters, daily.</li>
        <li>COVID-19 can be diagnosed similarly to other conditions caused by viral infections: using a blood, saliva, or tissue sample. </li>
